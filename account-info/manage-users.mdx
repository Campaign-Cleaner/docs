# User Management And Roles
[Campaign Cleaner](https://campaigncleaner.com) provides you the capability to include additional users in your account to assist in the management and enhancement of your campaigns. We designate two roles: `administrators` and `users`.

**Administrators**, fundamentally, have complete access and control over the account. This includes the ability to purchase and cancel subscriptions, create API Keys, view invoices, manage users, among other tasks.

**Users**, on the other hand, have more limited access. They can optimize any campaigns, manage the CDN and utilize the API Keys allocated to them.
