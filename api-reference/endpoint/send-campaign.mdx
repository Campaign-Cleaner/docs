The **send_campaign** API Endpoint allows you to send in a campaign to be processed and analyzed by [Campaign Cleaner](https://campaigncleaner.com). Below is the list of settings that can be set, all optional settings, if not specified will default to the bold/italicized setting.

All submitted campaigns will be sanitized and CSS inlined.

#### <u>Request Body:</u>

_Required:_

**send_campaign**:

- **campaign_html** : The full HTML of your email campaign.
- **campaign_name**: The name of your campaign - campaign name must pass our sanitization checks.
    

Campaigns are normally processed in under 2 minutes, in most instances in a few seconds. But in some cases with very large campaigns with lots of images and links it can take longer to check those links for blacklists, redirects. image sizes and more. Depending on the server where those links resources are located it can take longer. The send campaign, will return a campaign ID once we received it, you can use that campaign ID to check on the status, and retrieve your campaign when it's finished processing or you can supply us a webhook URL and we will send the results to you automatically.

_Optional:_

**send_campaign**:

- **adjust_font_colors**: (_**true**_/false), If true, certain bright colors are spam triggers, like "**red**" or "**#FF0000**", will be adjusted to a slightly different color like "**#FF0101"**, it will look the same, but won't trigger some spam filters.
- **adjust_font_size**: (_**true**_/false) If true, you will be able to define the min and max font size allowed in pixels. If your newsletter contains larger or small font's it will adjust them to the min/max you define.
- **convert_h_to_p_tags**: (true/**false**) If true, this will change all the H tags to P tags and set the correct font-size.
- **convert_tables_to_divs:** (true/**false**) - This is an experimental feature to convert all the tables to divs, in certain instances with a complicated table structure you might need to edit the HTML. We recommend leaving this as false or not setting it.
- **custom_info:** This field is for you to pass any additional data you want to send us, it will also be passed back to you when you call the get_campaign API. It's limited to 500 characters. - It must pass our sanitization checks.
- **host_extensionless_images:** (true/**false**) If true, images without extensions will be hosted on our CDN when the **resize_and_host** parameter is set to true. Typically, dynamically generated images lack extensions, though there are exceptions.
- **image_max_width:** (int) When this is specified, it will add an max-width style to all images. it is not desirable for the image width to exceed the default campaign width.
- **inline_css:** (**true**/false) When set to true, CSS styles are directly applied within the style attribute of each HTML element.
- **inline_css_important:** (true/**false**) When set to true, the `!important` flag will also be inlined with CSS styles. If you are using media queries, it is generally recommended to keep this set to false.
- **media_queries_important:** (**true**/false) When set to true, all media query styles will be marked with the `!important` flag. This ensures they can override any inline CSS without an `!important' flag.
- **min_font_size_allowed**: (_**10**_) (A positive Integer, under 100) The **min_font_size** must be smaller or equal to the **max_font_size** in pixels

- **remove_css_inheritance**: (_**true**_/false) If true, removes all elements of CSS that are inherited. Once CSS is inlined, the inherited CSS will be removed, for example if font-size of a parent tag is 15 pixels, there is no need for the font-size of the child tag to be specified as 15 pixels because it's inherited or computed from the parent tag, this reduces the size of your HTML Campaign.
- **remove_control_non_printable:** (**true**/false) If true, all non-printable and control characters are removed.
- **remove_image_height:** (**true**/false) if true, the height style is removed from all images, preventing any image distortions. Only the width property should be set on images sent in emails.
