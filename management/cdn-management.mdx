# How To Effectively Manage Your CDN
At [Campaign Cleaner](https://campaigncleaner.com), we understand the significance of managing and hosting your images to ensure they're optimized for size and speed. Our CDN Management tools offer a seamless interface to upload, remove, copy the link, and inspect your images on our content delivery network.

Our [Resize And Host](https://docs.campaigncleaner.com/en/resize-and-host) feature intelligently scales images to their actual display dimensions, enhancing email load times, before adding it to our CDN.

Beyond email, our CDN is versatile, allowing you to host images for various other needs. However, please be aware that images on our CDN are publicly accessibleâ€”only upload what you're comfortable sharing with the world.

<Warning>
Note that images will be purged from our CDN 30 days after your subscription end, assuring that emails sent during your subscription period maintain their integrity for recipients who may not check their inbox regularly.
</Warning>
