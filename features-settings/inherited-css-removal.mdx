# Why is Inherited CSS Removal Important?

![inherited-css-removal-1.png](/images/inherited-css-removal-1.png)

When a child element has the same CSS property as its parent, it inherits the property value from the parent by default. This means that the CSS property doesn't need to be explicitly defined on the child element, and removing it from the child element can help reduce the overall size of the email.

Inherited CSS can be particularly problematic when dealing with large and complex HTML emails, as it can result in redundant CSS code that unnecessarily increases the email size and load time. This can have a negative impact on email deliverability, as larger emails are more likely to be flagged as spam or rejected by email servers.

By removing inherited CSS from your HTML emails, you can reduce the size of your email code and improve its performance and deliverability. This can also make it easier to maintain and update your email templates, as you can avoid duplicating CSS code across multiple elements.

# Use case for the removal of inherited CSS
<Note>
You are an email marketer and you want to send out a marketing campaign to your subscribers using an HTML email template. The template consists of a header, footer, and several sections with different types of content. You've defined a set of CSS styles for the header and footer and have also defined some basic styles for the section elements.
 
While designing the individual sections, you notice that some of them are inheriting the same CSS styles from the parent section element. This can cause the email code to be unnecessarily large, which may affect its performance and deliverability. To address this, you decide to use a campaign cleaner tool or script that can automatically detect and remove redundant CSS properties from the child elements.
 
By removing these redundant CSS properties from the child elements using [campaign cleaner](https://campaigncleaner.com), you can significantly reduce the overall size of your email code, which can help improve its performance and deliverability. Additionally, by avoiding duplicating CSS code across multiple elements, you can also make your email template easier to maintain and update in the future.
