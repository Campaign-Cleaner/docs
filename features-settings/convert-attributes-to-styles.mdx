## How does it happen?
This situation typically occurs when attempting to transform website HTML into email HTML. Many websites favor using relative paths, as they are either directly serving images or linking to content located in a different section of the website. This approach, while effective for websites, encounters issues when applied to email HTML due to the differing nature of resource linking in emails. 

## How to Convert Relative Links?

At campaign cleaner we provide a tool that will detect relative links in the `HTML` and allow you to quickly convert them `absolute URLS`. 

This feature is found under `Clean Campaign` --> `Tools` --> `Convert Relative Links`

Just type in your `BASE URL` and click `Update My Links`
