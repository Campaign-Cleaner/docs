# The Text To Link Analysis Guide
Text to link analysis is a critical tool in ensuring that email campaigns get delivered to the intended recipients. The ratio of text to links in an email is one of the key metrics used by email clients to determine if an email is spam or not. A high number of links in an email without enough text content can trigger spam filters and cause the email to be marked as spam or even blocked by the email client.

Sharing links in emails is helpful since recipients can then visit any page you want them to with one simple click. However, including too many links is another email mistake that can get your emails marked as spam.

[Campaign Cleaner's](https://campaigncleaner.com) text to link analysis feature helps marketers identify emails with a high ratio of links to text and make necessary adjustments to improve deliverability. The tool analyzes the email and provides a report on the ratio of text to links, which enables marketers to optimize their email content accordingly. By keeping the ratio low, marketers can ensure that their email campaigns are delivered to the intended recipients and avoid triggering spam filters.

In addition, text to link analysis also helps improve engagement rates with email campaigns. Emails with too many links can appear spammy and reduce the trust and credibility of the sender. By focusing on creating high-quality content with a balanced ratio of text to links, marketers can build trust and engagement with their audience, resulting in higher open and click-through rates.

# Use Case for using the Text To Link Ratio Analysis
<Note>
A company is preparing an email campaign to promote their new product launch. They have included several links within the email to redirect the readers to their product page, social media pages, and other relevant information. Before sending out the email campaign, they use a tool like Campaign Cleaner to analyze the text-to-link ratio and check for missing or unsecured links.
 
Upon analysis, the tool highlights a few issues with the links. It shows that there are too many links in the email body, which may trigger spam filters or make the email look cluttered. The tool also points out that one of the links is missing the title attribute, which may affect accessibility for some users.
 
The company makes the necessary adjustments, reducing the number of links and adding title attributes to the missing link. This helps to improve the text-to-link ratio and ensures that all links are secured and accessible, increasing the chances of the email being delivered to the recipient's inbox and improving engagement with the email.
 
By using Text To Link Analysis, the company was able to improve the overall deliverability and effectiveness of their email campaign, leading to a higher engagement rate and increased conversions.
