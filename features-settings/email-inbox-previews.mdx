# Email Inbox Previews Use Case

<Note>
A travel agency specializing in European destinations faced challenges with their email marketing campaigns due to diverse client requirements and varying email client compatibilities. To address this, they turned to Campaign Cleaner's Inbox Previews feature, which allowed them to preview and adjust their emails across a wide range of email clients and devices before sending.

Using Campaign Cleaner, the agency was able to detect and rectify issues that could potentially hinder email deliverability and reader engagement. This proactive approach not only improved the aesthetic consistency of their emails but also boosted open rates and customer interactions, significantly enhancing the overall success of their marketing campaigns.
