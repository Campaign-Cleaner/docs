# How is CSS Inlining Helpful?

Inlining CSS is helpful for email delivery because many email clients don't support the `<style>` tag or external CSS files. Instead, they require all CSS to be included inline within the HTML document. By inlining CSS, email designers can ensure that their emails render consistently across all email clients, even those that don't support external CSS.

Inlining CSS can also help improve email deliverability. Many spam filters use algorithms to analyze the content of emails, and they may flag emails that have suspicious-looking external CSS files or stylesheets. By inlining CSS, designers can avoid triggering these filters and increase the chances that their emails will be delivered to recipients' inboxes.

There are a few different ways to inline CSS, including manually copying and pasting the styles into the HTML code or using a CSS Inliner tool like [Campaign Cleaner](https://campaigncleaner.com). A CSS Inliner tool is a program that automatically converts external CSS stylesheets or `<style>` tags into inline styles that can be applied directly to HTML elements.

In the first image below, is an example of `<style>` tags used in HTML. The second image will show it being inlined into the HTML which is the proper way to send HTML emails.

Below you can see the `<style>` tags were removed, we also removed the `class` attribute, which is another feature of [Campaign Cleaner](https://campaigncleaner.com), since it's no longer needed. Additionally, the `<h1>` tag should be to a `<p>` tag, because it will inherit the CSS of the email/browser client. Which is another feature [H to P Tag Conversion](/h-to-p-tag-conversion) that can be turned on.
