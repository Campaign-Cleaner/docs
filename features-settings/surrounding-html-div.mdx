# The Importance Of A Surrounding DIV
Wrap your email campaign in a div container and apply default CSS styles to control your offer's appearance and make it more visible to readers. This technique is especially helpful for affiliate offers, as it prevents them from inheriting styles from the email client or other styles in your email template. Defining the styles within the div ensures that the offer looks consistent and professional across different devices and email clients.

Commonly used CSS styles for the surrounding div include font-size, text alignment, max-width, and horizontal centering to the parent element. This simple approach can significantly improve the appearance and performance of your email offers by making them more engaging and eye-catching. By increasing click-through rates and conversions, it can help you achieve your marketing goals and improve your ROI.
