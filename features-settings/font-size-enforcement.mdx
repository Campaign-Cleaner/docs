# Enforcing Min and Max Font Sizes
Enforcing a minimum and maximum font size in email can help improve email delivery, accessibility, and even reduce the likelihood of triggering spam filters. By setting font size limits, you can ensure that your emails are optimized for readability and compatibility across a wide range of devices and email clients, while also avoiding potential red flags that may trigger spam filters.

Setting a minimum font size can help ensure that your emails are accessible to all subscribers, including those with visual impairments or using smaller screens. This can improve engagement and conversion rates, while also avoiding potential accessibility compliance issues.

On the other hand, enforcing a maximum font size can prevent emails from appearing cluttered and overwhelming, making them easier to read and navigate for subscribers. This can also help avoid potential spam filter triggers, as excessively large fonts may be flagged as spammy or manipulative.

By enforcing a min and max font size in your email templates, you can also ensure that your emails appear consistent and professional across different email clients and devices. This can help avoid potential delivery issues, as well as improve the overall user experience for subscribers.
