<Note>
An email marketer wants to send a promotional email campaign to his subscribers. He create an HTML email template with some comments in the code to remind yourself of certain elements or to leave notes for other developers.
 
When he send the email campaign, some subscribers report that they are not receiving your emails, while others report that the emails are taking a long time to load or appearing broken in their email clients.
