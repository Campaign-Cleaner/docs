# Why is HTML Sanitizing Important?

When it comes to email delivery, HTML sanitizing can be extremely helpful in avoiding the spam box.

Many email clients and spam filters have strict guidelines regarding what types of HTML code are allowed in emails, and any suspicious code can cause the email to be flagged as spam or blocked entirely. By using an HTML sanitizer to remove any code that could be seen as suspicious or malicious, email senders can greatly increase the chances of their emails making it to the recipient's inbox.

In addition to protecting against spam filters, HTML sanitizing can also improve the overall user experience by ensuring that emails are displayed correctly across all email clients and devices. This can help to build trust with recipients and improve engagement rates, leading to more successful email marketing campaigns.

In this example, the `meta` tag was removed because it's not necessary for email rendering, and the `script` tag was removed because it's potentially harmful and may trigger spam filters in some email clients. The other differences you see was that the `<h1>` tag was converted to a `<p>` tag, because the H to P Tag Conversion option was turned on in this example as well.
