# Why Do We Do Blacklist Link Recurison Testing?
Blacklist Link Recursion Checking is an important technique for improving email deliverability. When sending out email campaigns, it's common to include links to external websites, but these links can often be a source of problems. If any of the links are blacklisted by spam filters, your email is likely to be marked as spam, which can harm your reputation and reduce the chances of future emails reaching the inbox.

One way to avoid this is to use Blacklist Link Recursion Checking. This technique checks all the 301 redirects of all the links found in your email campaign. By doing so, it can detect if any of the links lead to a blacklisted website, even if the original link itself is not blacklisted. This means you can identify potential issues before sending your emails, and make the necessary changes to ensure your emails have the best chance of reaching your subscribers' inboxes.

Not only does Blacklist Link Recursion Checking improve deliverability, it can also help you understand which links are the most problematic. If you consistently see links that lead to blacklisted websites, it may be worth reviewing your content and considering whether it's necessary to include those links in future campaigns.

Our process includes verifying the links within our content against domains that are flagged on blacklists. While many organizations limit their checks to RBL's such as the one available at https://multirbl.valli.org/lookup/, we extend our scrutiny to additional platforms such as PhishTank, Google Transparency Report, and others. This extra step ensures that if a user clicks on any link, they wonâ€™t be hindered by blockades that prevent access to the linked destination.

# Use Case for Blacklist Link Recursion Testing

<Note>
A marketing agency is tasked with creating an email campaign for a client. The agency knows that email deliverability is critical for the success of the campaign, so they decide to use Blacklist Link Recursion Checking as a part of their email validation process.
 
The agency creates the email campaign and runs it through their validation tool which uses Blacklist Link Recursion Checking from [Campaing Cleaner](https://campaigncleaner.com/). The tool tests all the 301 redirects of all the links found in the email, ensuring that there are no spammy or malicious links that might cause the email to be flagged as spam or blocked by ISPs.
 
After validating the email, the agency sends it out to the client's subscribers. Thanks to the Blacklist Link Recursion Checking process, the email is delivered to the subscribers' inboxes instead of getting caught in spam filters.
 
The agency monitors the email campaign and sees that the open and click-through rates are higher than average, indicating that the email was well-received by the subscribers. The client is pleased with the results and the agency has earned their trust by ensuring the success of the email campaign through effective email deliverability techniques.
