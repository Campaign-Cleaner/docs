# Removing Large Widths On Elements In HTML

When it comes to email design, it's important to optimize your code for performance and deliverability. One way to do this is by removing large width attributes from elements other than images and tables.

Large width attributes can cause issues with email rendering and may make your email appear distorted or broken in certain email clients. Additionally, large width attributes can increase the overall size of your email code, which can slow down load times and negatively impact deliverability.

By removing large width attributes from elements such as `divs`, `spans`, and `other HTML tags`, you can help ensure that your email code is lean and efficient. This can lead to faster load times and better overall performance, which can help improve engagement and increase click-through rates.
