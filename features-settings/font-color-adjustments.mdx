Avoid colors that trigger spam.
 
An email with a red or green font has a high chance of landing in the spam folder. Similarly, white text written over an image or light-colored background can also land your email in spam. 
 
So try avoiding these practices to ensure that your email lands directly in your recipient's inbox and your hard work doesnâ€™t go to waste.
