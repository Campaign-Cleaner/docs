# Is Text To Image Analysis Real?
The text-to-image ratio in an email plays a crucial role in its deliverability. Emails with a high text-to-image ratio are more likely to land in the recipient's inbox rather than the spam folder. Email filters tend to flag emails with high image content as suspicious, as spammers often use images to evade detection. By reducing the text-to-image ratio, you can improve your email deliverability rates and increase the chances of your emails being opened and read.

**Here's the source code from the SpamAssassin, the #1 Open Source anti-spam platform.**

As you can see, SpamAssassin has specific code that will flag the text to image ratio, we deploy more of a word to image ratio, which seems to work well within the parameters of all spam filters.

Text-to-image analysis is an effective way to determine the text-to-image ratio in your emails. It allows you to identify emails with high image content and take steps to optimize them for better deliverability. Once you identify emails with a high image content, you can reduce it by adding more text or reducing the total number of images being used. 

In addition, [Campaign Cleaner](https://campaigncleaner.com/) also provides a way to automatically convert, resize, and host images on out Ultra-Fast Global CDN Edge powered by Cloudflare.
