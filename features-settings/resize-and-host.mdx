2. Under the `Campaign Analysis` tab, there were be a `Resize and Host` link in the `Image Summary` section.

Hovering over the links displays the complete URL of an image and thumbnail of the actual image. A `red sizing icon` indicates an image is too large and should be resized; a `green sizing icon` signals the image is appropriately sized.
