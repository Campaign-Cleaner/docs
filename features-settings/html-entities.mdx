## Automatic Conversions

Campaign Cleaner will automatically convert non-ascii symbols into their HTML Entities.  For example.


1. - Registered Trademark Symbol (®)
   - HTML Entity: `&reg`;
   
2. - Copyright Symbol (©)
   - HTML Entity: `&copy`;

3. - Degree Symbol (°)
   - HTML Entity: `&deg`;


I added the Symbols below into campaign cleaner.

![html-entity-1](/images/html-entity-1.png)

Pressing `Clean Campaign` will trigger the conversion. The conversion can also take place when other functionality is used as well. 

![html-entity-2](/images/html-entity-2.png)
