Campaign Cleaner will automatically convert non-ascii symbols into their HTML Entities.  For example.



1. - Registered Trademark Symbol (®)
   - HTML Entity: `&reg`;
   
2. - Copyright Symbol (©)
   - HTML Entity: `&copy`;

3. - Degree Symbol (°)
   - HTML Entity: `&deg`;


I added the Symbols below into campaign cleaner.

![(]html-entity-1](/images/html-entity-1.png)

Pressing `Clean Campaign` will trigger the conversion. The conversion can also take place when other functionality is used as well.
