Diacritics characters are letters with accent marks, such as `á, é, ñ, and ü.` While they are commonly used in many languages, including Spanish, French, and German, they can pose a challenge for email delivery. Some email clients and spam filters may not recognize or display diacritics characters properly, leading to rendering issues or even email rejection.

To ensure compatibility across email clients and avoid spam filters, many email marketers choose to replace diacritics characters with their plain ASCII equivalent. For example, `á becomes a`, `é becomes e`, and so on. This process is known as diacritics characters replacement.

By performing diacritics characters replacement in email content, marketers can improve the deliverability and readability of their emails. This technique ensures that the text displays correctly on a wide range of email clients and devices, including those that do not support or recognize diacritics characters.

In addition to improving email deliverability and compatibility, diacritics characters replacement can also improve the overall user experience for subscribers. By ensuring that the text is readable and accessible, email marketers can better engage their subscribers and increase the effectiveness of their email marketing campaigns.
