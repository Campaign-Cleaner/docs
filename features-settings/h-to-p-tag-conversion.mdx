# Why is H to P Tag Conversion Important?

Converting `h` tags to `p` tags with inline styles is an important practice in email design for several reasons. First, `h` tags have a higher default font size and weight than `p` tags, which can result in inconsistent formatting across different email clients. By converting `h` tags to `p` tags with inline styles, designers can ensure that the font size and weight are consistent across all email clients, improving the overall readability and user experience.

Secondly, many email clients have default styles for `h` tags that can override custom styles, resulting in inconsistent formatting. By using `p` tags with inline styles, designers can have greater control over the formatting of the text and avoid any potential conflicts with default styles in email clients. This can also help to ensure that the email looks the way it was intended, regardless of the email client being used to view it.

Overall, converting `h` tags to `p` tags with inline styles is an important practice for creating consistent and readable emails that can be viewed across multiple email clients. By using `p` tags with inline styles, designers can have greater control over the formatting of the text, avoid conflicts with default styles in email clients, and ensure a consistent user experience
