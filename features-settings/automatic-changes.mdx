## What Automatic Changes are made?

Campaign Cleaner is tailored for anyone engaged in email marketing, aiming to implement best practices to ensure consistent appearance across all email clients.

For example, while Apple Mail allows you to link to a specific font to enhance your email's appearance, such as `<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Notable&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">`, Gmail will ignore this. 

The result will be great looking emails in Apple Mail. But poorly aligned email with the fallback font other email clients.

To address this, Campaign Cleaner removes such elements, improving the likelihood of your emails maintaining consistency across different email clients.

### Below are some of the items we remove automatically:

1. All CSS Attributes that have no effect in the majority of email clients. 
2. All HTML Attributes that have no effect in the rendering of email.
3. All Javascripts. 
4. All Externally Linked CSS will be converted and inlined.
5. HTML Tags that should be used in email. 


### Limited Email support items we allow:

1. We do allow meta tags - although the majority of meta tags don't have and effect on emails or very minor effects. 
2. We do allow a Title tag - Some clients used it. 

### Items that will always change automatically or when a campaign is cleaned:

1. All CSS will be inlined, you do have the option to presevere media queries. 
2. All HTML Entities will be encoded.
3. We convert all font colors to HEX.
