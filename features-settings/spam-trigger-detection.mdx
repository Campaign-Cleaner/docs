# Removing Spam Trigger Keywords

![spam-trigger-1.png](/images/spam-keyword-ratio-2.png)

Email spam trigger detection is an important aspect of email deliverability that helps to ensure that emails are delivered to the intended recipients' inboxes instead of their spam folders. Spam trigger detection involves analyzing emails for certain elements or characteristics that are commonly associated with spam emails, such as certain keywords or phrases, excessive use of punctuation or capitalization, or the inclusion of certain types of attachments.

By detecting these spam triggers, email service providers can prevent spam emails from being delivered to their users' inboxes, which in turn helps to protect users from potential security threats and unwanted marketing messages. However, it is important to note that not all spam triggers are created equal, and some may be more relevant to certain industries or types of emails than others.

To ensure that emails are not incorrectly flagged as spam, it is important to test emails for spam triggers and make necessary adjustments before sending them. 

In today's world, it seems to be based on ratio's. Certain common words like `NOW` can be considered a spam trigger, but it depends on content and frequency. `Buy Now` vs `Please pick me up now`. They both have two different meanings, many spam filters use ratio's of trigger words vs actual content in the email to determine if the email should be filtered.

Different Internet Service Providers (ISPs) employ various technologies for handling emails, which can lead to differing views on the relevance of spam keywords. Some ISPs, such as Gmail and Yahoo, use advanced technologies that may assign less importance to spam keywords and more important to sender reputation when classifying emails. 

SpamAssassin doesn't know you sending reputation, it's logic based and relies heavily on Spam Keywords and public blacklist data to make an assessment. The ISPs that depend solely on SpamAssassin, spam keyword detection significantly influence email delivery.

## Cable ISP Companies

Many cable companies still consider spam keywords to be crucial, assigning them a higher weight in their email classification systems. This could be due to their reliance on older, potentially outdated technology or not.

## Spam Confidence Level

Microsoft, for example, uses a "Spam Confidence Level" (SCL) score for every email. This score reflects the likelihood of an email being spam, indicating that spam keywords still play a role in email classification at certain ISPs.

## Apple's Content Scanner

Apple, uses a "Content Scanner" score for every email. This rating indicates the probability of an email being classified as spam, suggesting that spam-related keywords continue to influence email categorization at Apple. If you review email bounces you would see bounces with the code `CS01` or `CS02` in your logs, the `CS` stands for Content Scanner.
