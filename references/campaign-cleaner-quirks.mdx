Sometimes, you may notice something that doesn't seem quite right. If this occurs, please reach out to us through the contact page. We utilize a variety of technologies to simplify your campaign optimization efforts without requiring extensive HTML knowledge. However, we recognize that no solution perfectly suits every scenario. 

Here's a list of quirks, that we will update when we find them also, that we are not going adjust at this time.

<Accordion title="My Images or Links Appear Broken, When They Are Not">

    <b>Possible Cause:</b> We replace unicode characters with their ASCII equivalent, If you're using unicode chacaracters in your file or image names, they can and most likely will appear to be broken. We thought about not changing images and links, but decided against it at this time. 

    <b>Solution:</b> Rename your images without using unicode characters. You probably didn't know you were to begin with or perhaps you are using the MacOS screenshot software which will put in a u202f unicode character by default in the file name between the time and AM/PM. Changing the system time to 24 hours will fix this. You can also turn off the date function in the screenshot with the following command in Terminal “defaults write com.apple.screencapture "include-date" 0”

    <b>Reason:</b> Please Read [Non-ASCII Character Replacement](/features-settings/non-ascii-character-replacement). There are some replacements that we do without this setting turned on.

    <b>Best Practice:</b> Stick to ASCII for Maximum Compatibility, if you want to ensure the broadest compatibility, especially across different systems and in network environments, sticking to ASCII characters in filenames is safest.

<Accordion title="My Images Appear Broken, When They Are Not">

    <b>Possible Cause:</b> Most mondern browsers will display the HTTPS version of images (If one exists), even if you specificy the HTTP version. Chrome calls this the HTTPS-First Mode, which is enable by default. If the HTTPS version of your image is different or if the SSL is expired, the images will show as broken.

    <b>Solution:</b> Fix the SSL Certificate for the HTTPS version of your images, or remove the HTTPS path for your images.

    <b>Reason:</b> Please Read [Chromium Blog - Towards HTTPS by default](https://blog.chromium.org/2023/08/towards-https-by-default.html).
    
<b>Best Practice:</b> Also use HTTPS Images and links in email.
