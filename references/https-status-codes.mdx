title: HTTP Response Status Codes
---
HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed.
Responses are grouped in five classes:

1. Informational responses (`100` – `199`)
2. Successful responses (`200` – `299`)
3. Redirection messages (`300` – `399`)
4. Client error responses (`400` – `499`)
5. Server error responses (`500` – `599`)

The status codes listed below are defined by [RFC 9110](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9110.html#overview.of.status.codes).



<Note> If you receive a response that is not in [this list](#information_responses), it is a non-standard response, possibly custom to the server's software.</Note>

## Information Responses

**100 Continue**
   - This interim response indicates that the client should continue the request or ignore the response if the request is already finished.

**101 Switching Protocols**
  - This code is sent in response to an request header from the client and indicates the protocol the server is switching to.

**102 Processing**

 - This code indicates that the server has received and is processing the request, but no response is available yet.

**103 Early Hints**
  - This status code is primarily intended to be used with the HTTPHeader("Link") header, letting the user agent start preloading resources while the server prepares a response or preconnect to an origin from which the page will need resources.
