# Import an Existing Campaign
Submitting your campaign to Campaign Cleaner is easy! Simply follow the steps outlined under "Submit Campaign," and we'll analyze your email directly from your campaign software. This allows you to make any necessary changes and ensure your email is optimized before it reaches your audience.

<Note>
If you import a campaign with [embedded images](/references/embedded-images), Campaign Cleaner will put those images on our Blazing Fast Public CDN and change the HTML to reference those images automatically.
