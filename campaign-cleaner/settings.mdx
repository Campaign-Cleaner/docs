# Campaign Cleaner Settings - You're In Control

[Campaign Cleaner](https://campaigncleaner.com) provides a wide range of settings that offer complete control over how your HTML is optimized, resulting in a boost in engagement and ROI. The settings are divided into three main sections for easy management:

1. Toggle Settings - These settings can be toggled on and off to control specific features of your campaign.

1. Advanced Settings - A lot of the magic happens here, as these settings consist of toggles and user input that control the dynamics of your campaign.

1. Always On Settings - These settings are based on analytics and won't change or update your Email Campaign's HTML, except for the mandatory CSS Inliner and HTML Sanitizer.

Each campaign can have different settings, and these settings are saved with your campaign. For new campaigns, the default settings are inherited from the previous campaign settings used.

# Toggle Settings
