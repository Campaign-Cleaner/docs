# Saved Campaigns - Everything You Need to Know
This section enables you retreive all your saved email campaign and can store multiple versions of it for future reference. All campaigns submitted through email or API are saved in this section. You can easily load any saved campaign into the HTML editor by clicking on a `load` button or download it to a text file that can be imported into your email campaign tool.

With this feature, you can effortlessly manage and keep track of your saved email campaigns by sorting, searching, and deleting as needed. This allows you to make changes without having to start from scratch each time.
