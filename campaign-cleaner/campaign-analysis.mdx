# Understand Your Email Campaign Analysis 
The HTML Analysis tab is organized into 9 user-friendly sections, with highlighted areas of concern in orange, so you can quickly identify and optimize your email campaign. Each section includes an "info" button for more details. Let's take a closer look at these sections

# Punctuation, Caps and H Tags

This section identifies common issues that can harm your email's deliverability by triggering spam filters. The ratios shown are the maximum recommended values, and it's always best to stay well below them.

All-caps words and successive punctuation are among the most heavily weighted conditions that can land your emails in spam folders or promotions tabs.

# Spam Keyword Ratio

This section highlights any spam keywords found in the content of your email campaign. While it's nearly impossible to have zero spam keywords, having an excessive amount of them can raise a red flag. For instance, if a particular spam keyword, such as "Free," is used multiple times in conjunction with other spam keywords, it can make your email appear very spammy and suspicious. In this example, "Free" is used 7 times, which is considered high and may result in a lower deliverability rate.
