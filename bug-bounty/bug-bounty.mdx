 ## Introduction
 
 Campaign Cleaner is committed to ensuring the security and integrity of our software as a service (SaaS) platform. We understand that no technology is perfect, and we appreciate the work of security researchers in making the internet a safer place. To encourage responsible disclosure, we have established a Bug Bounty Program to reward those who help us identify and fix vulnerabilities in our system.
 
 ## Scope
 
 The Bug Bounty Program covers the Campaign Cleaner SaaS platform, accessible at campaigncleaner.com. This includes all web pages under the campaigncleaner.com,  members.campaigncleaner.com, our API endpoints.
 
 ## Out of Scope
 
 The following are considered out of scope for our Bug Bounty Program:
 
 - Physical attacks against Campaign Cleaner offices and data centers.
 - Social engineering attacks against Campaign Cleaner employees or contractors.
 - Any third-party websites or services integrated with Campaign Cleaner.
 - Denial of service attacks.
 - Spamming.
 - Vulnerabilities in software not directly controlled by Campaign Cleaner.
 - Reports of insecure SSL/TLS ciphers or other common SSL/TLS vulnerabilities.
 - Reports of missing security headers which do not lead directly to a vulnerability.
 - Issues related to software or protocols not under Campaign Cleaner's control.
 - Reports of out-of-date software or libraries without a demonstrable, exploitable vulnerability.
 - Reports about lack of password complexity, account lockouts, CAPTCHAs, or other user protection features.
 - Reports of missing best practices (e.g., autocomplete attributes, lack of rate limiting, email enumeration).
 - Reports that state that software is vulnerable with no actionable information.
 - Reports of vulnerabilities affecting users of outdated or unpatched browsers and platforms.
 - Reports of vulnerabilities in our blog or social media accounts.
 - Reports of vulnerabilities in our email or office infrastructure.
 - Reports of vulnerabilities that require physical access to the user's unlocked device.
 - Reports of CSRF on forms available to anonymous users (e.g., the contact form).
 - Reports of user enumeration.
 - Reports of missing cookie flags on non-sensitive cookies.
 - Reports of missing security headers which do not lead directly to a vulnerability.
 - Reports of descriptive error messages (e.g., stack traces, application or server errors).
 - Reports of misconfigurations without identified security impact (e.g., SPF records, DKIM, DMARC).
 - Reports of vulnerabilities related to auto-fill web forms.
 - Reports of clickjacking on pages with no sensitive actions.
 - Reports of issues that are not directly related to an attack scenario or a vulnerability (e.g., company policy decisions, presence of autocomplete attributes, lack of password complexity restrictions, etc.).
 
 ## SQL Injection Policy
 
 Campaign Cleaner takes the threat of SQL Injection seriously. If you believe you have discovered a potential SQL Injection vulnerability, we encourage you to report it immediately.
 
 When reporting a potential SQL Injection, please provide the following:
 
 - A detailed description of the vulnerability, including the part of the system where it was discovered.
 - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability, including any code or commands used.
 - The potential impact of the vulnerability, such as what data could be accessed, modified, or deleted.
 - Any suggestions you have for fixing the vulnerability.
 
 Please note that you must not exploit a potential SQL Injection vulnerability beyond what is necessary to demonstrate it. Do not use an SQL Injection vulnerability to access, delete, alter, or share data that does not belong to you. Any actions that could harm the integrity of our user data or the system could lead to your disqualification from the bug bounty program.
 
 As with all vulnerabilities, the decision of what constitutes a valid SQL Injection vulnerability and the reward for reporting it is at the discretion of Campaign Cleaner.
 ## Reporting a Vulnerability
 
 When reporting a vulnerability, please ensure that it is a true security vulnerability that could potentially be exploited to harm the system or its users. While we appreciate reports on deviations from best practices, please note that not all such deviations constitute a vulnerability or a bug.
 
 - A detailed description of the vulnerability.
 - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
 - Any relevant screenshots or screen recordings.
 - Your contact information.
 
 
 ## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Policy
 
 Campaign Cleaner recognizes the severity of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. If you believe you have discovered a potential XSS vulnerability, we encourage you to report it immediately.
 
 When reporting a potential XSS vulnerability, please provide the following:
 
 - A detailed description of the vulnerability, including the part of the system where it was discovered.
 - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability, including any code or commands used.
 - The potential impact of the vulnerability, such as what actions an attacker could perform or what data they could access.
 - Any suggestions you have for fixing the vulnerability.
 
 Please note that you must not exploit a potential XSS vulnerability beyond what is necessary to demonstrate it. Do not use an XSS vulnerability to access, delete, alter, or share data that does not belong to you. Any actions that could harm the integrity of our user data or the system could lead to your disqualification from the bug bounty program.
 
 As with all vulnerabilities, the decision of what constitutes a valid XSS vulnerability and the reward for reporting it is at the discretion of Campaign Cleaner.
 ## Rewards
 
 Rewards for vulnerabilities are determined based on the severity of the vulnerability, the complexity of exploiting it, and the potential impact. The classification of severity is at the discretion of Campaign Cleaner. The reward range is as follows:
 
 - Low severity: `$25 - $50`
 - Medium severity: `$50 - $100`
 - High severity: `$100 - $200`
 - Critical severity: `up to $1000`
 - Campaign Cleaner Swag
 
 Please note that all reward amounts are in USD.
 
 Due to legal and regulatory restrictions, we may not be able to provide rewards to researchers in certain countries. We will do our best to work within these constraints, but we appreciate your understanding if we are unable to provide a reward due to these restrictions.
 
 ## Rules
 
 - You must be the first person to report the vulnerability.
 - You must not disclose the vulnerability to anyone else until we have fixed it.
 - You must not exploit the vulnerability for any reason other than to demonstrate it to us.
 - You must not use the vulnerability to access, delete, alter, or share data that does not belong to you.
 - You must not violate any laws in the course of your research.
 
 ## Testing Paid Functionality

 ## Legal
 
 By participating in the Campaign Cleaner Bug Bounty Program, you agree to comply with all applicable laws and regulations. You also agree not to disrupt or compromise any data that is not your own. Campaign Cleaner reserves the right to determine the eligibility of participants and the validity of vulnerabilities at its sole discretion.
 
 Thank you for helping us keep Campaign Cleaner safe and secure. We look forward to working with the security community to improve our service.
