We use the data we collect from you to provide our services, manage your account, process payments, communicate with you about your account or our services, provide customer service, and improve our services. The legal basis for processing your personal data depends on the specific context in which we collect it.

## Nature of the Data Processing ##

Our software designed for the sole purpose of processing and analyzing data related to email campaigns. In accordance with the Data Processor's Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, these email campaigns should not contain any sensitive or private data.

You agrees to only use the software to process data that does not include personal identifiable information, financial details, health-related information, confidential business information, or any other type of information that is considered private, sensitive, confidential, or protected under applicable laws or regulations.

You assumes responsibility for ensuring the content of email campaigns aligns with these requirements. Any non-compliance with this clause will be considered a breach of this agreement.

## Data Minimization ##

We adhere to the principle of data minimization, ensuring that personal data collected is adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary for the purposes it is processed.

Access to your personal data is restricted to employees and third-party processors who have a business need for such access.
