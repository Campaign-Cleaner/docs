Campaign Cleaner employs Google Analytics as a third-party tracking service. However, we do not use it to track individuals or collect personal data. Google Analytics helps us gather insights into website performance and user behavior in a general sense. This includes evaluating website usage, generating statistical reports, and enhancing content and website functionality.

Google Analytics collects information over time, such as IP addresses (which are not accessible to us), browser type, internet service provider, referring and exit pages, time stamp, and similar data about your use of our website. We do not link this information to your username. Google provides further information about its own privacy practices and offers a browser add-on to opt out of Google Analytics tracking.
